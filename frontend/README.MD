**Note**

According new document of [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) they recomended: 

> if you are building a new app or a site fully with React, we recommend using a framework.

That means [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/), it's now full-stack framework.

Though I have to use `react` so I am using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to install it as per the [ReactJS](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) documentation
___
## How to use it:
* For the the first time you need to install `vite` globally.

**NPM**
```bash script
npm create vite@latest
```

**yarn**
```bash script
yarn create vite
```
## Run the project
```bash script
git clone -b frontend https://github.com/LL08-MathematicalModelling-dowell/100100-DowellCustomerneeds.git
```
```bash script
cd frontend

npm install
npm run dev
```
